Game Evaluation Criteria
========================
This readme.md file outlines the evaluation criteria for a 3D game project. These criteria are used to assess different aspects of the game, including viewing, control, playability, 3D effects, coding style, design style, polish, and innovation. Each criterion is associated with a percentage weight that contributes to the final grade.


**Viewing (10%)**

Loading 3D Scene: Does the game successfully initialize and load a 3D scene? Affirmative.

Scene Animation: Is dynamic animation present within the 3D environment? 
- Indeed, animation is evident through the movement of asteroids and the rotation of planets around the sun.

User View Control: Can players manipulate their perspective in-game? 
- Absolutely, users have the option to switch between first-person and third-person views.

Camera Movement: Is there any capability for camera movement within the game world? 
- Yes, but camera movement is restricted to the minimap, enabling users to navigate the world indirectly.

Animation Glitches: Are there any observable animation irregularities? 
- Notably, there are no noticeable glitches, though there might be a minor issue with the asteroids' animation.

3D Avatars: Are 3D avatars featured for main characters or other elements in the game? 
- Certainly, every element in the game, from spaceships to planets and even the sun, is represented in 3D.

Moving Objects: Do objects move in conjunction with the world, and are there items that follow the camera's movement?
- Objects such as planets and asteroids move with the world, while items like the collection counter and time counter are linked to the spaceship and move with the camera.

Multiple Views: Does the game offer various viewing perspectives, such as first-person, third-person, or a minimap?
- Users can seamlessly switch between first-person and third-person views.

Picture-in-Picture: Is there a picture-in-picture feature?
- Yes, the bottom-right minimap provides this functionality.

**Control (10%)**

Keyboard and Mouse Controls: Are keyboard and mouse controls integrated, and do they offer smooth gameplay? 
- Players navigate the spaceship using WASD controls, which provide a seamless experience.

Control Logic: Are the controls intuitively designed and aligned with the game's mechanics?
//TODO: Add more detail here

Effective Control: Do the controls effectively govern scene manipulation, viewpoint adjustments, and avatar interactions as required?
//TODO: Add more detail here

**Playability (10%)**

Objective: Does the game entail clear objectives, such as item collection or specific tasks? 
- Each level features objectives communicated by the commander.

Success and Failure: Can players achieve success or fail to meet the game's objectives? 
- Certainly, success or failure prompts a pop-up notification.

Competitive and Fun: Is the game competitive and enjoyable?
- There is a leaderboard on each level that shows how other players did in that level. The game is fun to play, and the leaderboard adds a competitive element.

3D Gameplay: Does the game effectively utilize all three dimensions, with controls appropriately responsive?
//TODO: Add more detail here

Physics Model: Does the game incorporate a functioning physics model, including collision and explosion mechanics?
- Collisions with non-objective items result in spaceship explosions and accompanying animations.

**3D Effects (15%)**

Graphical and 3D Effects: Does the game showcase various graphical and 3D effects such as anti-aliasing, depth tests, color utilization, multiple light sources, shading techniques, curves, surfaces, skyboxes, shadows, reflections, and refractions?
//TODO: Add more detail here

Creative Use of Effects: Are these effects employed creatively and in an aesthetically pleasing manner?
//TODO: Add more detail here

**Coding Style (10%)**

Best Coding Practices: Is the code adhering to best coding practices, including meaningful variable, function, object, and file naming?
//TODO: Add more detail here

Indentation and Comments: Is the code correctly indented and sufficiently documented?
//TODO: Add more detail here

Documentation: Is the code well-documented, offering insight into its functionality?
//TODO: Add more detail here

Version Control: Is the code version-controlled using Git or a comparable system?
//TODO: Add more detail here

Object-Oriented Programming: Is Object-Oriented Programming appropriately employed where relevant?
//TODO: Add more detail here

Design Style (25%)

Hierarchical Modeling: Assess the quality of hierarchical modeling and the rationale behind the design approach.
- Hierarchical modeling can be seen when add effects to the space ship such a flame is created which is added to the space ship.

Modeling Explanation: Elaborate on how the world, objects, and sub-objects were modeled and the reasoning behind these choices.
//TODO: Add more detail here

Advantages and Disadvantages: Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the chosen design approach.

**Polish (10%)**

Game Quality: Evaluate the overall aesthetics and user experience.
//TODO: Add more detail here

Restart Feature: Can the game be restarted without needing a page refresh?
- Using the in-game pause menu, users can restart the game without refreshing the page.

Performance: Does the game exhibit lag or performance issues?
- The game does not lag nor does it have any performance issues.

Dashboard/Menu: Is there an in-game dashboard or menu for user convenience?
- The escape button is used to pause the game and the user can restart the game from the pause menu.

Color Scheme: Is there a consistent and visually pleasing color scheme throughout the game?
//TODO: Add more detail here

Extra Features: Are there supplementary features or enhancements that elevate the gameplay?
//TODO: Add more detail here

**Innovation (10%)**

New Ideas: Evaluate the presence of innovative concepts within the game.
//TODO: Add more detail here

Unique Elements: Assess whether the game explores novel ideas, employs custom models and textures, incorporates unconventional effects or techniques, introduces networking or multiplayer elements, and utilizes sound, efficiency, speed, or other distinctive aspects.
//TODO: Add more detail here

Memorability: Determine if the game possesses unique qualities that make it memorable and distinguish it from others.
//TODO: Add more detail here

Controller Compatibility: Consider whether controller compatibility has been integrated.
- Controller functionality has been implemented.

Blender Usage: Take into account the utilization of Blender for modeling and texturing.
- Each and every model in the game has been created using Blender.

Explosions: Evaluate the implementation of explosive elements within the game.
- Explosions are implemented when the spaceship collides with an asteroid and when the spaceship collides with a   non-objective item such as black holes, planets and the sun.
